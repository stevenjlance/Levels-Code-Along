# Adding Levels

We are going to add levels to our game! To practice this we are going to first add levels to a simple coin collector game.

The goblin's score increases ever ytime the coin is collected. Using conditionals:
- Check to see if the score is larger than 5
- If the score is larger than 5, change the background and increase the speed that the goblin moves at.
